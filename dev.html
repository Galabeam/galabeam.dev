            I plan on working on this at some point.<br>
            I've already been working on it on and off but I'm not entirely committed.<br>
            Having Interrogation but more connected to the story would make it even better.

            This game uses the SPEARHEAD gun system which is the best gun system I've ever used.<br>
            Like a few years ago, me and my friend quickly made this as a fun project and then forgot about it.<br>
            But I've made the game way better than it previously was.<br>
            Since the original just had flipped Roblox assets, I wanted to keep that same style.<br>

            Another project made with one of my friends, we spent a lot of time on this and it turned out great.<br>
            Basically, you wake up from a gun shot and see (one of our friends) dead on his bed.<br>
            You have to go around and investigate to figure out what happened to him.<br>
            Now the story was kind of bad and not implemented that well<br>
            It had a lot of analogue references which didn't really tie into the story.<br>
            Regardless, it was a fun project.

        <p style="width: 100vw" class="gameelements">
            This project started in April of 2022 but there's been many downtimes in development.<br>
            Mainly just me overworking myself and getting burnt out.<br>
            <br>
            The premise is the Backrooms but you know, alternate.<br>
            New levels, modified levels, and so on.<br>
            <br>
            I've been working on it again recently and I hope to make a playable release!

            One of my first actual games on Roblox.<br>
            It's basically like all the other Don't Press The Button games but with my own events.<br>
            I was way younger so expect some goofy ahh things there.
